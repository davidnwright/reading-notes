Raiford Guins. *Game After: A Cultural Study of Video Game Afterlife*. Cambridge: MIT P, 2014.

"Journalist J.C. Herz wrestles briefly with the ontology of a video game when she poses the following question in her popular history of games: 'What is *Space Invaders*? Is it the code? Is it the arcade cabinet? Was it the idea in a Namco engineer's mind when he made it? What is the actual game?'" (9)

The quote above arises out of a discussion Guins is having about the "situation" where we find the game. And that we need to think as others have noted, more in terms of where games are located contextually and how the context in which we find the game influences how we receive it as a historical artifact (or, indeed, an artifact *of* history). The "situation" as Guins and critics such as Don Idhe and Peter-Paul Verbeek--both mentioned in Guins' work--would have it then determines the historical value of the object (Guins 12). Or, put more specifically, the context in which we receive the game object is important to understanding its historical place, if not its usefulness. In other words, we can move beyond the histories of the game itself--its playability, its code, its object--and think about the resonance of its histories or what Guins calls "afterlife situations" where "we can begin the study [games] when recontextualization defamiliarizes their everyday usage (or intensifies it?) and different conditions of knowledge enrich our historical understandings" (Guins 13). To answer Herz's question in Guins' terms, we might suggest that what *Space Invaders* is depends on where we find *Space Invaders* when we encounter it. 

I am interested in the same collisions between literary studies and prototyping. For me, the game is a literary term and the "afterlife situation" is the analytical position encouraged by reflection upon prototyping.
