Speaking to how Ereaders enable a collaborative reading of texts, Dennis Tenen notes that in so being,  "The work was preprocessed, in both technical and the social senses of the word, to privlege certain meanings and modes of comprehension" (Tenen 5). It is this move to preprocess that interests me through its connection(s) to the work of archivists who must also preprocess materials. What biases or otherwise does this presupposition suggest or yield? 

Tenen suggests that "Text is irrevocably intertwined with its stratified material contexts" (Tenen 5)

"The word is in the wires" (Dennis Tenen 5)

"Losing sight of the material contexts of knowledge production is politically perilous, because those who own the contexts set the terms of engagement" (Tenen 9). Thinking about this when I think of comparisons between two texts--like Cordell's move with James' "The Real Thing." It is not the writer that owns the context, but often the publisher!

"Devices that 'watch,' 'see,' and 'think' give rise to object-oriented ontology and the Internet of Things. A new generation of objects clamors for participatory intelligence. They claim space in the home, near the hearth. Smart phones, smart lightbulbs, smart thermostats, smart homes, and smart watches enter the networked public sphere in the role of independent agents" (Tenen 10). There's something here about how these devices automatically post things. How they have agency, but perhaps not free will, unless the free will is in the glitch. 

FREE WILL IS IN THE GLITCH
