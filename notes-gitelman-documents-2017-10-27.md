Gitelman, Lisa. *Paper Knowledge: Toward a Media History of Documents*. Durham: Duke UP, 2014.

 

**Note:** There's lots of good stuff in here about genre and media. Particularly as these concepts intersect with LaTour's "inscription" and the everyday "tactics" of DeCeteau and Foucault's "author-function" (when the maker of the document or archive is also complicit in its creation--fillable forms--or its collection--the archivist. 

The book is nice jumping-off point for getting ideas about the books to read by the author's above. There's also some great examples of opaque academic writing.

"Documents are epistemic objects; they are the recognizable sites and subjects of interpretation across the disciplines, and beyond, evidential structures in the long human history of clues" (Gitelman 1)

"Documents are integral to the ways people think as well as the social order that they inhabit" (Gitelman 5)


"The meaning of documents thus inheres symbolically, materially, geographically, according to the contexts in which documents make sense as visible signs and/as material objects. A multitude of forms--some of them literally fill-in-the-blank forms--helped shape and enable, to define and delimit, the transactions in which they were deployed" (Gitelman 12) (((So then, the printer has agency and facilitates in my grandmother writing in her journal)))

"Filling up [empty or fill-in-the-blank printed things] evidently helped people locate goods, map transactions, and transfer value, while it also helped them to locate themselves or others within or against the sites, practices, and institutions that helped to structure daily life" (Gitelman 22) (((My grandmother's record of the weather in her diary is one such site or practice that jogs the memory, as is her emphasis on the social comings and goings of immediate relatives and friends who wander in and out of Restful Acres. It's telling that familiarity is itself marked by shortforms, familiar first names "Mike" not "Michael"; "RA" not "Restful Acres," which tells us something about the intended audience of the journal, which is still something of a mystery. 

 



"The histories of genres and the histories of media don't so much overlap as they intersect, constituting partial and mutual conditions for one another" (Gitelman 10)

"Media and genre support each other, as shared assumptions evolved amid the proliferation of related instances serve dynamically to underwrite and articulate the know-show function. The genre and its subgenres are recognizable by dint of repetition with variation, conditioned in part--at least in this present extended age of technological reproducibility--by the diverse media of their production and reproduction" (Gitelman 10)
