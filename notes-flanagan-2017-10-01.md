"In organized play and games, rules have a mechanical rigor and are followed as procedures. These take on a kind of algorithmic specificity as players enact meaning through following rule sets. In this way, technological change has been interlinked with changes in play and gaming practices" (Flanagan 8).

"Critical play means to create or occupy play environments and activities that represent one or more questions about aspects of human life" (Flanagan 6)

"Criticality can provide an essential viewpoint or an analytical framework. Those using critical play as an approach might create a platform of rules by which to examine a specific issue--rules that would be somehow relevant to the issue itself. Critical play is characterized by a careful examination of social, cultural, political, or even personal themes that function as alternates to popular play spaces" (Flanagan 6).  

Flanagan define activist games as "Activist games can be characterized by their emphasis on social issues, education, and, occasionally, intervention. In other words, they are not purely conceptual exercises, but rather, games that engage in a social issue through, most commonly, themes, narratives, roles, settings, goals, and characters; and less commonly, through game mechanics, play paradigms, interactions, or win states to benefit and intended outcome beyond a game's entertainment or experiential value alone" (Flanagan 13). This is a justification for using games to study literature and help examine the collision between technology and humanities. Designing the game is a technology. 

"There is something about designing play, especially the process of conceptualizing and making games, that requires an attention to possibility" (Flanagan 252)

"As in art, the creation of play and games necessitates rule making at a fundamental level. Even simple role-playing activities, or playing house, both seemingly limitless open-play scenarios, include implicit or explicit rules that establish behaviour, possible actions, environments, and the safe zone for play itself" (Flanagan 252)

"Like activists, game designers also follow an overall scheme of investigation or research, creating processes to address specific concerns and ideas. In addition, the creation of rules of operation makes interesting constraints to provoke innovation in both the designer's process and the player's role" (Flanagan 252).

"[Networked computer games] must be seen as spaces of translation, already transformed by game designers and the growing number of game players: international, transbordered, fluid" (Flanagan 253)..... "now, more than ever, electronic games constitute cultural spaces" (Flanagan 253).

"games are simultaneously systems of information, cultural products, and manifestations of cultural practice. [...] systems such as games must, due to the conditions of their creation, represent cultural norms and biases in their realization" (Flanagan 254).

"what is distinctive about play is that one cannot always easily see that a clear boundary exists between it and social reality, or rather, see that play uses the tools of everyday reality in its construction" (Flanagan 254).

"The disruption of contemporary games, whether through play, or preferably, through original designs that eschew the embedded interaction style of current computer games may offer models for other emerging practices in playculture. Designer actions are powerful sites of empowerment for giving a voice to marginalized groups" (Flanagan 256)

"Games are artifacts of historical and cultural importance, but they are also something *beyond artifact* in that games also function as a set of activities that carry conventions like audience role, interaction, currency, and exchange" (Flanagan 259).

Flanagan notes, after extrapolating Janet Murray's ([*Hamlet on the Holodeck*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck) 126) definition of agency as the ability to make meaningful choices, that "Artist-created board games use this theory to its fullest, providing table-based mini laboratories for this examination of choice, chance, and social interaction" (Flanagan 116).

"Giacommetti's board games," Flanagan argues, might "offer a critique of even the possibility of agency, implying that playing or enacting the sculptural games boards would be futile, cyclical trap" (Flanagan 116).

"Metaphoric or actual, the game design must embody action, and depending on how active a game feels, its critique may be more or less apparent" (Flanagan 116).

"Like other board games, if a chess set is missing a given piece, it is understood that something else might actin substitution for that piece. Thus, a lofty eraser might be played by an eraser or lipstick . In any event, the piece itself is viewed with its particular affordances and powers, having for both players all of the abilities and limitations of the rules that govern the piece. Using substitute objects in a game in this manner emphasizes that the transactions involved are so symbolically robust that the game's rules and processes can allow for pieces to stand in for one another, for games to forge their won control over temporality, and consensus to be reached among players about how to interact. With these abilities, games produce not only cohesive rule sets but also cohesive worlds, and words that express meaning" (Flanagan 111). This is a key statement because it allows games to function as interpretively creative spaces. In other words, we can have conversations about what object we might pick as a replacement and how these choices are never arbitrary--one can imagine a Drag Queen chess set or representing cultural battles (gay marriage) through the choices we make on the game board. The Chess board then represents all structures of power--short of its rules, the feudal set up and metaphor and organization of the Chess board forces players to confront all hierarchies of representation, not just the transmutation of that hierarchy into replacement objects... the signified becomes embroiled in the Chess hierarchy... the bottle cap cannot be a King and the driftwood must be a pawn suggests the priority of industrial objects over natural objects--or drinks over nature! 

"games are legitimate forms of media, human expression, and cultural importance, and the ways games reflect the norms and beliefs of their surrounding cultures is essential to understanding both games themselves ands the insights they may provide into human experience. In this playculture approach to media, board games become one of several artifacts of material culture used to trace social practices and beliefs. Games actions and rules can be characterized as principle play features, and these foci are not unique to games but are also shared across language systems, social orders, and ties of kinship, law, and ritual" (Flanagan 67). True, and games also expose the inherent bias or social systems (patriarchy, Whiteness, "civilization," moral codes) inherent in the game design or the decisions about how it should be played, or even which rules to follow and which rules to ignore--how someone approaches the game matters--will they follow these rules or not? Why not? Why do they follow them? What are the structures that govern these choices?

"a great deal of pleasure for players can be derived from subverting set interaction norms in both simple play environments and highly complex games. Players will consistently explore what is permissible and why pushes at that boundary between rules and expectations, and a player's own agency, within any given play environment (Flanagan 13).
