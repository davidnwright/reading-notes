Computer mainframes "were more architecture than object" (xi)

	- I like this quote for the allusion to my own work on the etherial nature of architectural memory--that it is the insides of buildings that we remember, not the facades. This would seem to play with the relationship between object and architecture as well, as if they were two different things. Not sure they are...

"computers are not singular machines, complete unto themselves, but complex hybrid objects that are multiply layered and dependant on external systems" (xvii)

	- Seems like an obvious point, but one which we often neglect. Again, that "loss of signal" quote is important. 

	- This stuff also got me thinking about the loss of signal when we move from analogue to digital or from one space to another... some energy is lost... a law of thermodynamics I think... wondering how this infiltrates the creative process.  

"Resituating 'peripherals' as central to the history and theories of computation would demand that we attend to the historical materiality of particular computational systems not as they were intended at the outset but as they were adjusted and modified in actual practice. It highlights the necessity of considering partial elements, such as screens and disk drives, in any discussion of the 'affordances' within any computational system.  It emphasizes the need to situate these partial elements within increasingly larger economic rings--computer systems but also political, social, and economic systems within which the material practices of computation acquire meaning and significance. And finally, it asks that we consider what it would entail to reconceptualize the writing of history--both computer history and more general histories of technology and culture--from  perspective of this kind of 'peripheral vision.' This social-materialist model's oblique perspective might enable ti to emphasize the key fault lines that inevitably persist beneath the surface of our familiar, overarching narratives. (xvii-xviii)

	- key point for my work with floppy disk drives I think... perhaps the foundational idea. It's precisely the point... also misses a few things (keyboards) and doesn't quite define "peripheral" well enough, but I'm being picky--you leave it open because it wants to be open.
