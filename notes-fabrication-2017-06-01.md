"Fabrication and Research-Creation in the Arts and Humanities" - Nicole Clouston and Jentery Sayers - in *Doing DH* (I think) Crompton, Ed.

Chapman and Sawchuk: "four types of research-creation -- 'research-for-creation', 'research-from-creation', 'creative presentations of research', and 'creation-as-research' (2012: 15 - "Research-Creation-Intervention, Analysis and 'Family Resemblances'" Canadian Journal of Communication 37 (2012): 5-28)

"Whatever the aim, prototyping can be an informative process for experimentation and development, and the materials used influence how interpretation happens" (Clouston and Sayers 321).

"historians can reconstruct an experiment from the past in order to better understand how this became that. This process may facilitate writing and argumentation--or research-from-creation--without any investment in circulating a product for acquisition or review" (Clouston and Sayers 321).

"one of the most interesting aspects of digital fabrication is the availability of component parts as digital files and code" (Clouston and Sayers 322)

"Across formats and materials, these different versions of a single project prompt researchers to think between bits and atoms (Sayers *et al.* 2016), without neatly dividing digital from analogue from print from screen from whatever is held in hand" (Clouston and Sayers 322).

"One appeal of this approach is that people can print, cut, etch, or mill objects they download, with whatever materials and machines they have. Another is that manufacturing can happen off-site, and the printed files can be delivered (e.g. by Shapeways). This option is ideal for people who do not want to invest in or maintain CAM technologies. Finally, with fabrication projects available online, objects are not only rendered as open editions, conducive to crowdsourced sculpture projects such as 'Linked' by Jeff de Boer and PrintToPeer (https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/crowdsourced-3d-printed-sculptures-are-the-knitting-circle-of-the-future); under particular licenses (e.g. Creative Commons licenses), they can also be modified or particular settings and needs. Their sizes, textures, surfaces, infills, and resolutions can be edited with computer-aided design (CAD) software such as Rhinoceros or SketchUp. From a materials design perspective, this plasticity implies more than manipulating and object's form, surface, content, and metadata. Its physical substance is no longer stable, either. A piece intended for wood can be manufactured elsewhere in acrylic. A project meant for paper can later be cut into fabric. 
   While it may be tempting to claim that, with digital fabrication, all materials and their distribution are reduced to code--available in their entirety as abstractions or symbolic expressions--practitioners should note that code is physical, too: stored somewhere, impressed on a drive, transmitted through wires." (Clouston and Sayers 323)

"Such research-for-creation can start small: surveys of metadata vocabularies and preservation strategies, education about sourcing and preservation, site visits (including visits to like-minded labs and studios), environmental scans of protocols for savvy reuse or repurposing, the development of procedures for extending the shelf lives of residual media (Acland 2007 (*Residual Media* MIT P), and designing infrastructures for repair instead of replacement (Rosner and Ames "Designing for Repair? Infrastructures and Materialities of Breakdown" 17th Annual ACM Proceedings 319-331). Collectively, these practices afford a long-term approach to research-creation by way of fabrication" (Clouston and Sayers 324).

"With respect to the aesthetics of digital fabrication, one issue in particular persists across arts and humanities projects, namely whether the object is standalone or assembled. This distinction affects how audiences are involved in the interpretation process. Is the object meant to be looked at? Observed? Is it meant to be articulated? Handled? Something in between? Answers to these questions will likely depend on discipline and researcher preference" (Clouston and Sayers 324).

"Even if digital files assemble easily on screen, they may not do so as tangible objects. Also, the materials used for manufacturing will play a role in the neatness or difficulty of assembly. 
   Another common issue with respect to aesthetics and assembly is the material connotation. Does the fabricated material correspond with history in some way? Does it create an indexical relationship? Does it point to something or someone? Is it intended to evoke a particular felling, thought, or interaction? In what value systems is it embedded? Again, answers to these questions will likely depend on discipline and researcher preference. Still, researchers should consider how materials make arguments, or how they assert themselves in arts and humanities projects" (Clouston and Sayers 324)

- All true, but what about:

- How do we decide what to print?
- Hasn't this ability to reproduce always been the case? The difference now really is the precision of the copy--gone are the flaws that shifting materialities might produce or represent. Or, those flaws become the intervention itself--why are they there? Were they always there? Are they revealed by the shifting materiality? And off the young academic goes down the critical thinking road.
- It would seem what might get lost in conversations about shifting materiality is that what makes 3D CAD fabrication so appealing is the perfection of the copy and the ease with which one can attain a high standard of reproductive perfection. Beyond the simple ability to do it--there is the "wow factor" of the precision--we have always been able to shift material states (book to movie, scarf to blanket, t-shirt to rag) but the ability to maintain the object's *intended state* across those shifting materialities is what's different now and, to some extent, what those shifting materials might reveal about the original that is hidden by its native materiality.
