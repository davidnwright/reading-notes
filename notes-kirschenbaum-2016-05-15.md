Reading Notes - 0006

Kirschenbaum, Matthew G. *Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing*. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2016.

Thinking of this book as useful for understanding of dealing with my coding / comment work. Thinking about how we treat the comments as a material trace of the authorial intent in an electronic sense. We treat the comments as we do archival notes, or even interpretive scripts, left by authors. We don't use them to determine agency, but to help us reconstruct or even represent the process of writing the code itself. In short, the comments help us decode the code.

"WordStar was initially inspired by what we would today call a hack.: Barnaby [Rob Barnaby, programmer of WordStar] had previously taken the command-line editor already built into CP/M [an operating system for Osborne and Kaypro computers] (which allowed a programmer to enter and revise code one line at a time) and made the screen display instead a full page of text" (Kirschenbaum 3).

- Here I am thinking about the connection between coding software or software designed specifically for programming or to facilitate the writing of code and its connection to the act of writing. In other words, for composition on computers, was it the coding software the was "like" writing or was the software designed to facilitate writing. What agency did the process of writing software, or programming, have in the end product of the word processing software. This is to say that there is an intimate connection between the act of composition as it is understood by the coder and the act of composition as it is understood by the "author." I use those quotes because we "write" code and we "write" novels--the implication of connection has always been there. We need now more than ever to start cataloguing the archives of code writing as equal to the task of writing itself. It's not just the software itself that needs to be archived, but also the ancillary material that accompanied the writing of that software (I'm using "writing" deliberately there). We need to do this not only to perpetuate coherent theories of authorship but also to preserve how coding, programming, software writing, with its collaborative approach, multiple evolutions, etc., debunks what we might see as established (one author syndrome) versions of the creative process when it comes to writing.
	- comics doesn't have one author, but we always point to him (deliberate)
	- novels don't have one, but copy editors, typists, agents, etc., are left out
	- archives reconstruct the whole process, they do not necessarily reflect the mythology

"Mark Poster influentially yoked electronic writing and electronic media to poststructuralist theory, and spoke in explicitly Derridean terms about computers 'dematerializing' the 'trace' of writing; he celebrated the 'evanescent, instantly transformable' texts thus created" (Kirschenbaum 5).

- Have never read Postman's book: *The Mode of Information: Poststructuralism and Social Contexts.* Chicago, U of Chicago P, 1990 (quote above from page 111). Probably should read that.

Software programs are technological artifacts too--Rob Barnaby's 137,000 lines of assembly code that formed the basis for the original WordStar were a kind of virtual machine, humming along without a hitch only because the wrenches in the system were systematically removed one by one in the painstaking process of debugging (Kirschenbaum 6). 

- See stuff on code as archive above. 
- But also thinking here of debugging as revision or editing and how the comments left by those coders shed insight into the process of revision. The announcement that a line of code is "perfect. do not touch" would suggest at once hubris and authority that we might need to explore. Particularly how that "perfect" line of code holds as we shift from platform to platform.
- More about how there are similarities between the process of writing code and publishing software and the writing of texts and its publication. 
- In this age of remediation--one that is happening at an incredibly fast pace--being able to trace how adaptations in the code were made and even the exchanges between different authors of the code may shed light onto how code / writing responds to shifting materialities or shifting ways of representation or shifting paradigms for cultural production and display.

"Any analysis that imagines a single technological artifact in a position of authority over something as complex and multifaceted as the production of a literary text is is suspect" (Kirschenbaum 7)

- Use this to justify why thinking about the comments in coding are important by changing the "literary text" above to coding or by showing how coding is a literary text. I'm still not sure why we need the word "literary" in there; it seems to imply some sort of elitism, as if distinguishing the "literary" means that if its not "literary" we can be all the "position of authority" we want to be. Not every text needs to be "literary"; it just needs to represent a moment of potentially significant to cultural production (in one place and one time). I mean, how will this change when we occupy other planets?

MASSIVE SIDEBAR:

- How does inhabiting other planets change how we understand cultural production. If it's not produced on Earth, then what? Do our interpretive tools still hold? How do we catalogue? Do we? Archives anyone? Where are they held? The code that sits on mars in the rovers and that travels with the Voyager spacecrafts is, in effect, a form of cultural production outside our planet's orbit. If someone could translate that code, run that math, parse that text / numbers; it would speak of us--our logic, our philosophies, our methods, our materiality. That code is what runs our machines--cultural, social, economic, scientific, religious.

"...the materiality of both work processing and of writing more generally. This materiality often has implications for interpretation, and it always has implications for preservation and documentation, for history and for memory. This is the scholar's art. But materiality always grounds us. It demystifies. Materiality is where--is how--our knowing begins" (Kirschenbaum 13).

- Sure, but what about the materiality that isn't grounded on earth? 
- We're finding other places. We're reading other places. 
- How do we "demystify" materialities manifested in / on places other than earth or near-earth orbit?

HAVE A LOOK AT HOW 2001: A Space Odyssey does or doesn't do this...
