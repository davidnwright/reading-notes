Drucker, Joanna. *SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Projects in Speculative Computing*. Chicago: U of Chicago P, 2009.

"Where, how, and through what means can we model our understanding of knowledge as a humanistic endeavor within the structures and strictures of our increasingly administered and digitally instrumentalized world? (Drucker *Speclab* xviii)

"Insofar as the formal logic of computational environments validates instrumental applications regarding the management and creation of digital artifacts, imaginative play is crucial to keeping that logic from asserting a totalizing authority on knowledge and its forms" (Drucker *Speclab* xiii)

"Making visible these subjective acts of interpretation, and the role of imaginative play, served to challenge the authority claims of formal logical systems. The event of interpretation in a digital environment includes many steps: creating a model of knowledge, encoding it for representation, embodying it in a material expression, and finally encountering it in a scene of interpretation" (Drucker *Speclab* xiv)

** Performativity from John L. Austin *How to Do Things with Words* Harvard UP, 1967: "a word, action, or behavior effects change, rather than simply stating, describing, or representing an idea, thought, feeling, or expression." (Drucker *Speclab* 202).
